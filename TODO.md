### Feature 005: Fix Live Current Speed Display Bug + UI Prioritization
- **Started**: 2025-11-07
- **Type**: P1 Bug Fix + P2 UX Enhancement (combined in single PR)
- **Description**:
  1. Fix current speed displaying hardcoded 0.0 km/h on Live tab during recording
  2. Prioritize current speed as hero metric (displayLarge) for safety-first design
- **Status**: 📝 Draft PR created - awaiting physical device testing
- **Implementation Summary**:
  - **Bug Fix (Speed Data Flow)**:
    - Domain layer: Added `getCurrentSpeed(): StateFlow<Double>` to repository interface
    - Data layer: Implemented StateFlow with `updateCurrentSpeed()` and `resetCurrentSpeed()` methods
    - Service layer: Emit GPS speed on every location update, reset on pause/stop
    - ViewModel layer: Expose StateFlow with `stateIn(WhileSubscribed(5000))` for battery optimization
    - UI layer: Collect speed from ViewModel and wire to RideStatistics component
    - Uses GPS Doppler speed (`location.getSpeed()`) when available (most accurate method per Android best practices)
  - **UI Enhancement (Safety-First Layout)**:
    - Current speed now PRIMARY display (displayLarge: 57sp) - hero metric
    - Duration/distance moved to SECONDARY row (headlineMedium: 28sp)
    - Average/max speed in supporting grid (titleLarge: 22sp)
    - Removed time-of-day display (low value, cluttered UI)
    - Aligns UI priority with safety mission (speed awareness > fitness tracking)
- **Git Commits**:
  - feba18f: docs - specification and tracking
  - ecdf7a7: feat(data) - repository StateFlow implementation
  - ccc7c08: feat(service) - GPS speed emission
  - be34815: feat(viewmodel) - StateFlow exposure
  - 7bdc739: fix(ui) - wire to LiveRideScreen
  - 24bd901: docs - emulator limitation and testing requirements
  - c240657: docs - update TODO.md with draft PR #6 link
  - 16df838: feat(ui) - prioritize current speed as hero metric
- **Build Status**: ✅ Debug APK builds successfully
- **Static Analysis**: ✅ Data flow verified correct (GPS → Service → Repository → ViewModel → UI)
- **Emulator Limitation**:
  - ⚠️ **Android emulator cannot test this feature**: `location.hasSpeed()` always returns false
  - Emulator's `emu geo fix` command only sets lat/lon, NOT the speed field
  - GPS Doppler speed is hardware-dependent and unavailable on emulator
  - Speed calculation from consecutive points is 10x less accurate (Stack Overflow consensus)
  - **Decision**: Skip emulator testing, require physical device validation instead
- **Tasks Progress**:
  - [x] Specification created (spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, tasks.md)
  - [x] Domain layer: Add getCurrentSpeed() interface method (T003)
  - [x] Data layer: Implement StateFlow with update/reset methods (T004-T008)
  - [x] Service layer: Emit GPS speed on location updates (T009-T013)
  - [x] ViewModel layer: Expose StateFlow to UI (T014-T016)
  - [x] UI layer: Collect and display current speed (T017-T019)
  - [x] Static analysis: Verify data flow correctness
  - [x] Research: GPS speed best practices (Doppler vs calculated)
  - [x] Draft PR created (PR #6)
  - [ ] **NEXT**: Physical device testing with real GPS (MANDATORY)
  - [ ] Unit tests: Repository and ViewModel coverage (T020-T029) - Optional for bug fix
  - [ ] UI tests: Compose test scenarios (T030-T034) - Optional for bug fix
- **Branch**: `005-fix-live-speed` (pushed to GitHub)
- **Pull Request**: #6 (Draft) - https://github.com/vlebourl/BikeRedlights/pull/6
- **Target Release**: v0.4.2 (patch release)
- **Testing Requirements**:
  - ✅ Constitution exception granted: Emulator testing skipped due to technical limitation
  - ⚠️ **Physical device testing MANDATORY before merge**: Test on real bike ride with GPS satellites

### Feature 004: Fix Auto-Resume After Auto-Pause
- **Completed**: 2025-11-07
- **Type**: P0 Critical Bug Fix (Safety Issue)
- **Description**: Fixed critical bug where auto-resume does not trigger after auto-pause, forcing cyclists to manually interact with phone while riding
- **Status**: ✅ Core implementation complete, ready for testing
- **Root Cause**: Auto-resume logic was structurally unreachable - trapped inside `updateRideDistance()` function which is only called when NOT paused
- **Solution**: Extracted `checkAutoResume()` function and relocated call to before pause gate, ensuring execution during AutoPaused state
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Created `checkAutoResume()` function (RideRecordingService.kt:440-500, 63 lines)
  - Integrated auto-resume call before pause gate in location update flow (line 434-436)
  - Removed unreachable duplicate code from `updateRideDistance()` (35 lines deleted)
  - Added FR-012 logging with rideId, speed, threshold for debugging
  - Build verified successful (0 compilation errors)
- **Code Changes**:
  - Modified: `app/src/main/java/com/example/bikeredlights/service/RideRecordingService.kt` (~50 LOC)
  - Total diff: +98 lines, -95 lines
- **Testing Status**: ⚠️ Pending physical device validation
  - Unit tests (T008-T016): Not implemented (manual testing preferred for P0 bug fix)
  - Emulator testing: Pending
  - Physical device testing (5 bike rides): Pending - **Required before production deployment**
- **Git Commits**:
  - 26a5fe2 "fix(service): implement auto-resume after auto-pause"
  - Specification: `specs/004-fix-auto-resume/spec.md`
- **Target Release**: v0.4.1 (patch release)
- **Next Steps**: Physical device testing with real GPS movement patterns required
