### Feature 006: Google Maps Integration for Route Visualization
- **Completed**: 2025-11-09
- **Type**: P1 Feature Enhancement (Feature 1B - Maps Integration)
- **Description**: Add Google Maps SDK integration with real-time route tracking on Live tab, complete route visualization on Ride Detail/Review screens, and map preview in Save dialog
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for PR and v0.6.0 release
- **Implementation Summary**:
  - **Core Architecture (Domain Layer)**:
    - Models: MapViewState, PolylineData, MarkerData, MapBounds, MarkerType enum
    - Use Cases: GetRoutePolylineUseCase, CalculateMapBoundsUseCase, FormatMapMarkersUseCase
    - Polyline simplification: Douglas-Peucker algorithm (3600 GPS points → ~340 points, 90% memory reduction)
  - **Map Components (UI Layer)**:
    - BikeMap: Reusable Google Maps wrapper with Material 3 dark mode support (JSON-based styling)
    - RoutePolyline: Renders GPS track with customizable color/width
    - LocationMarker: Blue marker for current GPS location
    - StartEndMarkers: Green start + red end markers for completed rides
  - **User Story 1: Real-Time Route Visualization (Live Tab)**:
    - Map displays current GPS location with blue marker during ride recording
    - Red polyline grows in real-time as GPS updates arrive
    - Camera follows user location smoothly at city block zoom (17f)
    - Pause/resume tracking works correctly
    - Integration tested with GPS simulation on Pixel 9 Pro emulator
  - **User Story 2: Complete Route Review (Ride Detail Screen)**:
    - Ride Detail screen shows complete route with map (300dp height)
    - Green start marker, red end marker, blue polyline for full route
    - Auto-zoom to fit entire route with LatLngBounds
    - Dark mode styling applies via MapStyleOptions JSON
    - Navigation from Ride History list item
  - **User Story 3: SDK Integration & Testing**:
    - Google Maps SDK (Maps Compose 6.2.0) configured with API key
    - MapTestScreen created for testing, then removed (cleanup)
    - Dark mode verified (light/dark theme switching)
    - Rotation handling verified (map state persists)
    - Emulator testing on Pixel 9 Pro (1280x2856, 480dpi)
  - **Additional Enhancements**:
    - **Save Dialog Map Preview**: Shows 200dp map with route before saving ride
    - **RideReview Screen Map**: Shows 300dp map after saving ride
    - **UX Consistency**: All screens now show maps (Save dialog, RideReview, RideDetail, Live)
    - **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful degradation for rides with no GPS data
    - **Gesture Support**: Pan, zoom, rotation controls working
    - **Accessibility**: 48dp touch targets, TalkBack support, content descriptions
  - **Testing Completed**:
    - Emulator testing on Pixel 9 Pro with GPS simulation
    - Dark mode verification (light/dark switching)
    - Rotation handling (portrait/landscape)
    - Edge cases (no GPS data, empty polylines)
    - Map gestures (pan, zoom, rotation)
    - Accessibility verified (48dp touch targets, marker titles)
- **Architecture**: MVVM + Clean Architecture with StateFlow, Maps Compose integration
- **Git Commits**: 10+ commits (SDK setup, domain layer, UI components, screen integration, testing, cleanup)
- **Task Completion**: 103/111 tasks (93%)
- **Target Release**: v0.6.0
- **Next Steps**: Create PR, code review, merge, version bump, release
- **Specification**: specs/006-map/spec.md, specs/006-map/plan.md, specs/006-map/tasks.md

### Feature 005: Fix Live Current Speed Display Bug + UI Prioritization
- **Completed**: 2025-11-08
- **Type**: P1 Bug Fix + P2 UX Enhancement (combined in single PR)
- **Description**:
  1. Fix current speed displaying hardcoded 0.0 km/h on Live tab during recording
  2. Prioritize current speed as hero metric (displayLarge) for safety-first design
  3. Add paused time display (manual + auto-pause combined)
  4. Add immobile time placeholder for future tracking
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Released v0.4.2
- **Implementation Summary**:
  - **Bug Fix (Speed Data Flow)**:
    - Domain layer: Added `getCurrentSpeed(): StateFlow<Double>` to repository interface
    - Data layer: Implemented StateFlow with `updateCurrentSpeed()` and `resetCurrentSpeed()` methods
    - Service layer: Emit GPS speed on every location update, reset on pause/stop
    - ViewModel layer: Expose StateFlow with `stateIn(WhileSubscribed(5000))` for battery optimization
    - UI layer: Collect speed from ViewModel and wire to RideStatistics component
    - Uses GPS Doppler speed (`location.getSpeed()`) when available (most accurate method per Android best practices)
  - **UI Enhancement (Safety-First Layout)**:
    - Current speed now PRIMARY display (displayLarge: 57sp) - hero metric
    - Duration/distance moved to SECONDARY row (headlineMedium: 28sp)
    - Average/max speed in supporting grid (titleLarge: 22sp)
    - Paused time in informational row (manual + auto-pause combined)
    - Immobile time placeholder (future feature for stopped-at-lights tracking)
    - Removed time-of-day display (low value, cluttered UI)
    - Aligns UI priority with safety mission (speed awareness > fitness tracking)
- **Git Commits**:
  - feba18f: docs - specification and tracking
  - ecdf7a7: feat(data) - repository StateFlow implementation
  - ccc7c08: feat(service) - GPS speed emission

### Feature 004: Fix Auto-Resume After Auto-Pause
- **Completed**: 2025-11-07
- **Type**: P0 Critical Bug Fix (Safety Issue)
- **Description**: Fixed critical bug where auto-resume does not trigger after auto-pause, forcing cyclists to manually interact with phone while riding
- **Status**: ✅ Core implementation complete, ready for testing
- **Root Cause**: Auto-resume logic was structurally unreachable - trapped inside `updateRideDistance()` function which is only called when NOT paused
- **Solution**: Extracted `checkAutoResume()` function and relocated call to before pause gate, ensuring execution during AutoPaused state
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Created `checkAutoResume()` function (RideRecordingService.kt:440-500, 63 lines)
  - Integrated auto-resume call before pause gate in location update flow (line 434-436)
  - Removed unreachable duplicate code from `updateRideDistance()` (35 lines deleted)
  - Added FR-012 logging with rideId, speed, threshold for debugging
  - Build verified successful (0 compilation errors)
- **Code Changes**:
  - Modified: `app/src/main/java/com/example/bikeredlights/service/RideRecordingService.kt` (~50 LOC)
  - Total diff: +98 lines, -95 lines
- **Testing Status**: ⚠️ Pending physical device validation
  - Unit tests (T008-T016): Not implemented (manual testing preferred for P0 bug fix)
  - Emulator testing: Pending
  - Physical device testing (5 bike rides): Pending - **Required before production deployment**
- **Git Commits**:
  - 26a5fe2 "fix(service): implement auto-resume after auto-pause"
  - Specification: `specs/004-fix-auto-resume/spec.md`
- **Target Release**: v0.4.1 (patch release)
- **Next Steps**: Physical device testing with real GPS movement patterns required
